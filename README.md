# android-code-challenge
This repo is for the Android coding interview for new developers :)

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR CANDIDATES:
*******************************

* This project was setup using Android Studio Koala, but please feel to use the latest release
version of Android Studio and update the project as required to write this challenge. 

* Please write the challenge using Kotlin and use any architectural patterns and libraries you
think are most well suited to complete the project. Using Jetpack Compose for UX is strongly
encouraged. 

* Don't forget to write some unit tests to demonstrate how you would test this project! 
You don't need to write full test suite if you have time constraints, but including a
sample of well written tests is critical to achieve a successful evaluation.

* Please put build instructions, assumptions and any other notes that you'd like your reviewers to 
know about in this file
